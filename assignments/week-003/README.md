You are likely to use these components:

1. Tiny DB: your app needs to remember a user did last time such a game score
2. Screen/orientation: you need to adjust size of the component on a screen
3. Multiple screens: there 2 ways to do multiple screens. One is obviously to add a screen, the other is to use one screen, show/hide only certain components based on a user's actions.
